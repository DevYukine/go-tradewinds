# Trading Strategies

All strategies inherit from `baseStrategy` and delegate decisions to an Agent.

## Strategy Interface (`internal/bot/strategy.go`)

```go
type Strategy interface {
    Name() string
    Init(ctx StrategyContext) error
    OnShipArrival(ctx, ship *ShipState, port *api.Port) error
    OnTick(ctx, state *CompanyState) error
    Shutdown() error
}
```

`StrategyContext` provides: Client, State, World, PriceCache, ProfitAnalyzer, Agent, Logger, Events, DB.

## Registry (`internal/strategy/registry.go`)

Maps names to factory functions:
- `"arbitrage"` → `NewArbitrage`
- `"bulk_hauler"` → `NewBulkHauler`
- `"market_maker"` → `NewMarketMaker`

## Base Strategy (`internal/strategy/base.go`)

Shared logic used by all strategies.

### On-Demand Price Scanning
- `ensurePortPrices(ctx, port)` — Checks if port prices are stale (>3 min) or missing, fetches fresh buy/sell quotes on demand using `PriorityNormal`. Called automatically by `buildTradeRequestWithPassengers` so ships never make trade decisions with missing price data.

### Request Builders
- `buildTradeRequest(ship, port)` — Assembles TradeDecisionRequest from state, includes `Params` map from `CompanyState.Params`
- `buildTradeRequestWithPassengers(ctx, ship, port)` — Calls `ensurePortPrices`, then extends with available/boarded passengers and P2P orders
- `buildFleetRequest()` — Assembles FleetDecisionRequest

### Trade Execution
- `executeSells(ctx, ship, sells)` — Batch quote + execute sells at port
- `executeBuys(ctx, ship, buys)` — Batch quote + execute buys, treasury floor check, destination routing
- `sendShipToPort(ctx, ship, destPortID)` — Find route, send transit, update local state immediately

### Fleet Execution
- `executeFleetDecision(ctx, decision)` — Sell ships, buy ships (with fallback), buy warehouses
- `tryBuyShip(ctx, purchase)` — Check shipyard inventory, try exact type then cheapest, try multiple ports

### Logging
- `logAgentDecision(type, req, resp, reasoning, confidence, latency)` — Save to AgentDecisionLog
- `recordTrade(exec)` — Save to TradeLog, call `recordRoutePerformance` on sells
- `recordRoutePerformance(sell)` — Match with recent buy of same good, create RoutePerformance record

### Snapshot Converters
- `shipToSnapshot(ship, world)` — ShipState → agent.ShipSnapshot (enriched with ship type info)
- `warehouseToSnapshot(wh)` — WarehouseState → agent.WarehouseSnapshot

## Passenger Sniping via World Events

The `CompanyRunner` subscribes to the public world SSE stream (`/world/events`) and listens for `passenger_request_created` events. When a new passenger group appears at a port:

1. Finds the best idle docked ship at the passenger's origin port
2. Prefers "passenger ships" (cargo capacity ≤ 60, has passenger slots) over cargo ships
3. Among same type, prefers ships idle longer
4. **Boards the passenger directly** via a single `BoardPassenger` API call — skips the full trade pipeline (price scanning, agent decision, etc.) to win the race against other players
5. If boarding succeeds, dispatches the ship through the normal strategy flow to sell cargo and choose the best destination (which now accounts for the boarded passenger)
6. If boarding fails (another player got it first), logs at debug level and moves on — no wasted API calls on the full trade pipeline

### Passenger Ship Spreading

Small/fast passenger ships relocate to uncovered ports (where no other company ships are docked) after just 1 idle tick — maximizing geographic coverage for sniping. Priority: uncovered hubs > uncovered non-hubs > covered hubs. This is handled in `speculativeTrade` in the heuristic agent.

### Immediate Fleet Purchase on Startup

When a company has 0 ships, the fleet evaluation interval is bypassed entirely — all strategies trigger fleet eval on the very first tick to purchase ships immediately.

## Arbitrage Strategy (`internal/strategy/arbitrage.go`)

Fast buy-low-sell-high across ports.

- `OnShipArrival`: Build trade request with passengers → agent decides → execute sells → buys → board passengers → sail
- `OnTick`: Fleet evaluation every 3 min (configurable via `FleetEvalIntervalSec` param)

## Bulk Hauler Strategy (`internal/strategy/bulk_hauler.go`)

High-volume trading with large ships.

- Same flow as arbitrage but agent favors high-value goods and large ship capacity
- Fleet eval every 3 min (configurable via `FleetEvalIntervalSec` param)

## Market Maker Strategy (`internal/strategy/market_maker.go`)

P2P market trading + NPC trading.

- `OnShipArrival`: Same NPC trade flow as arbitrage
- `OnTick`: Fleet eval (3 min) + market eval (1 min) — both configurable via params
- `evaluateMarket`: Fetch all open orders + own orders → agent decides → fill orders, post new orders, cancel stale orders

## Configurable Parameters

All strategies read timing intervals from `CompanyState.Params` (set by the optimizer's parameter tuner). If params are nil, hardcoded defaults are used.

| Parameter | Default | Used By |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `FleetEvalIntervalSec` | 180 (3 min) | All strategies |
| `MarketEvalIntervalSec` | 60 (1 min) | Market Maker |
| `MinMarginPct` | 0.05 (5%) | Heuristic agent trade decisions |
| `PassengerWeight` | 5.0 | Heuristic agent destination scoring |
| `PassengerDestBonus` | 5.0 | Heuristic agent passenger selection |
| `SpeculativeTradeEnabled` | true | Heuristic agent fallback behavior |

## Profitability Guards

The heuristic agent enforces several guards to prevent money-losing trades:
- **Minimum margin**: trades must exceed `MinMarginPct` (default 5%) of buy price
- **Sell-side tax**: profit calculation includes both buy and sell port taxes
- **Idle relocation**: after 2+ idle ticks (~60s), ships relocate to the nearest hub port or opportunity port instead of sitting idle. Hub ports are preferred because they have more trade variety.
- **Speculative sailing**: when enabled (default), ships sail to opportunity buy ports from the ProfitAnalyzer when no local trade is profitable
- **Cargo hold threshold**: ships only hold cargo for a better destination if the destination offers >50% better net price (high bar to keep ships moving)
- **P2P fill threshold**: 5% minimum margin for filling player orders

## ProfitAnalyzer (`internal/bot/profit_analyzer.go`)

Background analyzer that evaluates all cross-port trade opportunities using cached
price data. Maintains a ranked list of the top 50 opportunities (by profit/distance).

- **Recompute**: Called after each full scanner cycle. Iterates all price pairs to find profitable (buy port → sell port) routes.
- **Idle ship routing**: When a ship has no local trades, passengers, or cargo, the agent checks the ProfitAnalyzer for the best reachable buy port and sails there with purpose.
- **Destination scoring bonus**: Destinations that are sell ports of top opportunities receive a scoring bonus.
- **Idle tick tracking**: Ships track consecutive "wait" actions via `ShipState.IdleTicks`. Reset to 0 on any trade/sail action.

## Smart Selling

Instead of dumping all cargo at the current port, the agent evaluates each cargo
item against reachable destinations. Cargo is held (not sold) when a destination
offers >30% better net sell price after taxes. Held cargo:
- Reduces available ship capacity for new buys
- Adds a scoring bonus to the destination it should be carried to
- Is automatically sold when the ship arrives at the better port

## Destination Scoring

Trade decisions evaluate **all** reachable destinations, not just the single
best individual opportunity. For each destination, the agent simulates filling
the entire ship with profitable goods and computes a composite score:

| Factor | Arbitrage Weight | Bulk Hauler Weight |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| Total achievable cargo profit | ÷ distance | absolute |
| Passenger revenue at destination | ÷ distance × passengerWeight | ÷ distance × passengerWeight |
| Held cargo profit gain | ÷ distance | absolute |
| Route history bonus (avg past profit) | ÷ distance | absolute |

### Passenger Override

After choosing a destination, the agent checks if passenger revenue alone
(weighted by `PassengerWeight`) exceeds **half** of the expected trade **profit**
from the buy orders. If so, the destination is overridden to the best passenger
port. This aggressive override ensures passengers — the most reliable revenue
source — are rarely ignored in favor of marginal cargo trades.

## Route Performance History

The `buildTradeRequestWithPassengers` function loads the last 24h of
`RoutePerformance` records (up to 50) for the company. The heuristic agent
uses these to compute an average-profit-per-trade bonus for each destination
from the current port, biasing decisions toward historically profitable routes.
